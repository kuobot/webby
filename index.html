		<h1><center>Kitty Sez .......</h1></center>

		<div class="bubble">Everytime I see another article about how mobile is the future of everything and how businesses that don't have a mobile strategy in place are setting themselves up for longterm failure, I quietly go in the corner and make one of those really nasty little sneaky kitty shits.  You know, the ones you find months later after they're all covered in carpet fuzz?  Don't blame kitty, blame mobile apps and the pontificating weiners who shove them down everyone's throats.  You want mobile to be the future of everything?  Then start by creating one goddamn app that isn't a completely banal sack of mediocre crap with an idiotically designed interface.  The fact that it's smaller doesn't make it some technological marvel.  We've taken something that has been more or less perfected over time - big fat 40 inch interfaces - and shrunken them down to chicken shit minimized mobile versions that are awkward to use and don't have as much to offer.  This is the future of everything?  Don't make me the claw the hell out of your couch you little douche.  If apple can't even get that one thing where you turn your phone 90 degrees and the page flips accordingly to work more than 45% of the time, and if every other word I type gets auto-corrected in the absolute most retarded way imaginable then don't talk to me about how mobile is one of the greatest technological innovations of our time.  It's still just a nascent, prepubescent bitch.  Maybe someday mobile will do something that makes me give a shit, but for now, I really don't.  You keep using your tiny little app that can't do shit, and I'll keep using my giant 40 incher.<p>Meow.</p></div>
